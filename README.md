# GameBoy Emulator (WIP)

This is a work-in-progress GameBoy emulator written in C++, with plans to integrate SDL3 soon. The primary goal of this project is to create a fast, memory-efficient emulator that can run smoothly even on older hardware.

## Current Features
- Full implementation of all 501 GameBoy opcodes, with most instructions tested for correctness and accurate flag behavior.
- Interrupt handling implemented and tested.
- T-cycles for all instructions documented.
- Basic memory mapping, including some I/O registers.

## Planned Updates
- Accurate CPU timing and cycle counting.
- Basic implementation of the Pixel Processing Unit (PPU).

This project is in active development, so stay tuned for updates.
